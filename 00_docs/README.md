# 📂 00_docs — System Intelligence

This folder contains foundational documents to **understand, design, and communicate** the system-level logic behind **privacy-first signal architecture** and **RCA-based resolution thinking**.

It serves as both a **strategic briefing layer** and a **technical guide** — empowering executives, architects, and reformers to align on *why systems break* and *how to build them back stronger*.
