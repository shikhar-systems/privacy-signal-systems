# 📂 00_docs — System Intelligence

This folder contains foundational documents to understand, design, and communicate the logic behind **ZeroLeak RCA™** — a privacy-first, system-resilient framework for digital signal integrity.

It acts as both a **strategic briefing layer** and a **technical guide** — empowering executives, analysts, architects, and reformers to align on *why systems silently leak* and *how to build resilient, signal-trust systems*.
