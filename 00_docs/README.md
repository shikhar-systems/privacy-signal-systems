# 📂 00_docs — System Intelligence

This folder contains foundational documents to understand, design, and communicate the **system-level logic** behind privacy-first signal architecture and RCA-based resolution.

It serves as both a strategic and technical guide — helping teams, executives, and platform architects align on the "why" and "how" behind each signal decision.
