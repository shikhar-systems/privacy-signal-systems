# ðŸ§  Architecture Overview

This document outlines the core architecture behind Privacy Signal Systems â€” mapping the journey from user intent to RCA-backed resolution.

## ðŸ§© Layer-wise Breakdown

### 1. Consent Layer
- Captures user choices via banners, toggles, or contextual interfaces
- Common tools: OneTrust, TrustArc, in-house CMPs
- Logs include: region, time, preference granularity, legal basis

### 2. Signal Layer
- Executes tracking via GTM, GA4, Meta Pixel, LinkedIn Insight Tag
- Signal types: pageview, click, conversion, attribution
- Problems detected: overfire, underfire, misclassified, orphaned signals

### 3. RCA Layer
- Validates system breakdowns with architecture-backed diagnostics
- Converts issues into scalable use cases
- Links impact to business loss, compliance gaps, or user trust erosion

## ðŸ’¡ Summary

This architecture allows platforms to:
- Respect consent dynamically
- Ensure signal integrity across tools
- Resolve failures at the root, not the surface
