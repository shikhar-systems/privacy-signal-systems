# 🧠 Architecture Overview

This document outlines the core architecture behind **Privacy Signal Systems** — mapping the journey from user action to RCA-backed resolution.

It serves both as a **design reference** and a **strategic explainer** for decision-makers, system architects, compliance teams, and platform owners who need resilient signal flows built on privacy-first foundations.

## 🧩 Layer-wise Breakdown

### 1. Consent Layer
The entry point of trust. Captures user preferences and legal basis for tracking.

- Tools: OneTrust, TrustArc, Sourcepoint, in-house CMPs
- Interfaces: banners, toggles, pre-checks, granular opt-ins
- Logs include: region, timestamp, browser, legal basis
- Common errors: incorrect default states, broken logs, misaligned categories

---

### 2. Signal Layer
Where user interactions translate to events and data flows.

- Tools: GTM, GA4, Meta Pixel, LinkedIn Insight Tag, Segment
- Signal types: pageviews, clicks, conversions, attribution chains
- Common failures:
  - Overfire (duplicates)
  - Underfire (blocked/missing)
  - Orphaned signals (firing without consent)
  - Misclassification (wrong event parameters)

---

### 3. RCA Layer
The diagnosis and fix zone — issues here are transformed into system-level use cases.

- Uses RCA templates to document:
  - Root cause (system, compliance, infra)
  - Impact (data loss, business leakage, policy risk)
  - Fix logic (tech + policy + platform alignment)
- Outputs are added to the `use-cases/` folder with complete resolution flow and diagrams

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This layered architecture enables:

- **Clarity** — all signals must trace back to a consent origin
- **Resilience** — system fixes are scalable, not patchwork
- **Accountability** — audit-ready, business-aligned RCA reports
- **Trust** — user data is treated with fairness and transparency

---

## ✅ Sample Use Case Flow

Imagine a "form_submit" event firing even when the user opted out.

- Consent Layer: logs a "declined" preference
- Signal Layer: Meta Pixel still fires
- RCA Layer: reveals GTM misconfiguration ignoring consent check
- Resolution: update trigger logic + log RCA in GitHub + notify stakeholders

## 📌 How to Use This File

- Share with stakeholders to explain **why** signal failures happen
- Use as a **template** for building your platform's consent → signal → RCA flow
- Map your team’s tools and flows to this structure to identify weak links
