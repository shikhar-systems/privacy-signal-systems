## 📉 Where Money Leaks from Broken Signals

| Failure Type                    | Example Use Case                         | Revenue/Cost Risk Estimate        |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Campaign Misattribution        | `not-set` in GA4 medium/campaign         | ₹10–50L / month for scaled brands |
| Consent Misfire                | Tracking users without valid consent     | $250K+ legal exposure (EU/US fines) |
| Signal Overfire (SPA)          | Duplicate pageviews, wrong sessions      | 5–15% inflated session counts → bad optimization |
| Delayed Trigger (DOM-based)    | Missed conversion or quantity logging    | Direct loss in eCommerce tracking (₹1–5L / month) |
| PII Leakage in Pixels          | Unmasked email/name in Meta/LinkedIn     | Lawsuit potential + ad account suspension |
| Model Drift (AI Use Cases)     | Training on corrupted signal data        | Poor recommendations → lower engagement/retention |
