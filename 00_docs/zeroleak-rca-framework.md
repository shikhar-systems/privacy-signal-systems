# 🧠 ZeroLeak RCA™ Framework

**ZeroLeak RCA™** is a system-level method to detect, trace, and resolve **silent signal failures** across digital environments — especially those involving **GTM 360, GA4 360, consent layers, and complex data workflows**.

Where traditional debugging stops at broken tags, ZeroLeak RCA™ follows the **entire signal lifecycle** — from intent to delivery to data trust — and recovers what others miss.

## 🔍 Core Principles

1. **System-First Thinking**  
   RCA is not a bug fix — it’s an architecture alignment strategy. Every tag, cookie, and user signal is evaluated within system-wide flows.

2. **Signal Integrity Over Tag Status**  
   Just because a tag fired doesn’t mean the signal was valid. We trace what **actually reached the endpoint**, not what triggered.

3. **Consent-Aware Signal Pathing**  
   Respecting privacy means **understanding which signals were blocked, delayed, or downgraded** — and why.

4. **From Leakage to Redesign**  
   Every RCA concludes with a **signal recovery path** that prevents recurrence.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods Used

- **GTM 360 + GA4 360** (web & roll-up properties)
- **Consent Platforms** (OneTrust, CookieYes)
- **Browser Debuggers** (Tag Assistant, dataLayer inspector, network console)
- **Custom JS & Tracking Logic**
- **Architecture Flow Diagrams** (Mermaid or Draw.io)

## 📦 What Makes ZeroLeak Different?

| Traditional Debugging | ZeroLeak RCA™ |
|------------------------|----------------|
| “Why isn’t this tag firing?” | “Why did the signal fail across the system?” |
| Checks tag and trigger | Follows full flow: user intent → browser event → tag logic → network call → endpoint |
| Surface-level status | Deep root cause and redesign |
| Performed ad-hoc | Documented, pattern-driven, and repeatable |

---

## 🧠 Example Patterns Diagnosed

- Tag fired **before user intent was complete**
- Signals lost due to **delayed or blocked cookies**
- Attribution broken by **mismatched user IDs across platforms**
- DataLayer object pushed **after tag evaluated**
- Consent logic failed to resolve before firing sequence

> These patterns are tracked in `/patterns/` and reused across RCA vaults.

## ✅ Outcome

ZeroLeak RCA™ enables:

- High-trust attribution systems
- Privacy-compliant data pipelines
- Executive visibility into invisible system leaks
- Scalable RCA reuse across industries and tech stacks
