# 🔐 Privacy Signal Systems

**A system-first architecture for digital trust, signal resilience, and ZeroLeak RCA™ intelligence.**

---

## 🚀 Vision

In an era where **consent**, **signal integrity**, and **attribution trust** define business success, this repository introduces a modular, RCA-powered framework to debug and repair **invisible signal leaks** across digital ecosystems.

We go beyond surface-level bug-fixing — we build signal-aware systems from root cause to recovery.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Audiences

Designed for:

- 🧑‍💼 **Executive leaders** — navigating data trust, attribution loss, and compliance risk
- 👩‍💻 **Analytics & MarTech architects** — solving GTM-GA4-consent issues at scale
- 🧠 **Privacy-forward product teams** — building trust-preserving and intent-aligned journeys

## 🧠 What’s Inside

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `00_docs/` | RCA frameworks, system logic, industry ROI, and signal design blueprints |
| `10-zero-leak/` | Public ZeroLeak RCA™ vault — anonymized use cases from live ecosystems |
| `signal-watch/` | Pre-RCA bugs & signal inconsistencies awaiting confirmation |
| `visuals/` | Architecture diagrams, cross-view flows, and RCA snapshots |
| `tools/` | Debugging playbooks for GTM, ConsentMode, Cookies, and Tag Audits |
| `patterns/` | Reusable RCA patterns like misfired tags, cookie sync loss, and broken attribution |

## 💎 What is ZeroLeak RCA™?

ZeroLeak RCA™ is a handcrafted, signal-first root cause framework that traces:

- 🔁 Tags fired on wrong pages
- 🧩 DataLayer gaps breaking downstream tracking
- ❌ Consent blocks silently killing conversion signals
- 🔍 Attribution mismatches across ID systems
- ⚠️ Redirect chains causing pixel or cookie loss

Every RCA is anonymized, but rooted in real debugging from complex GTM-GA4-Consent setups.  
Screenshots are recreated with safe dummy flows — but the logic reflects **real-world impact**.

## 🔓 Public vs Private RCAs

We only publish select public RCA cases here.  
Full RCA loops — with client signals, budget impact, and recovery maps — remain securely archived.
