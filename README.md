# Privacy Signal Systems

**A systems-first approach to building privacy-compliant, resilient, and RCA-ready analytics infrastructures.**

This repository is a curated collection of real-world use cases, signal breaks, root cause analyses, and predictive QA strategies—centered around web analytics, consent governance, and signal reliability in high-stakes digital environments.

## 🔍 Why This Exists

Modern analytics systems are noisy, fragmented, and often non-compliant.

- **Consent breaks silently happen** on Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- **Meta Pixels** can leak PII even after front-end sanitization
- **GA4 ‘not set’ and ghost data** corrupt trust in reporting
- **Server-side tagging** doesn’t solve signal blindness

> This repo is for those who need answers *before the breach*, not after.

## 🧠 Who Is This For?

- **VPs of Analytics / CIOs / PMO Leaders**
- **Privacy Officers & Legal Teams (GDPR/CCPA/DPDP)**
- **Solution Architects & System Designers**
- **GovTech Builders and Policy Thinkers**
- **Founders building digital trust from Day 1**
