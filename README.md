# 🔐 Privacy Signal Systems

**A system-first architecture for digital trust, signal resilience, and ZeroLeak RCA™ intelligence.**

---

## 🚀 Vision

In an era where **consent, precision, and attribution integrity** define digital success, this system delivers a modular RCA-driven approach to:

- Detect invisible signal failures  
- Recover broken attribution paths  
- Build resilient tracking architectures

We don’t just debug — we design RCA systems that *harden digital trust at the architecture layer*.

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- 🧑‍💼 **CxOs, VPs & Growth Leaders** — uncover silent data leaks and misattributions  
- 👩‍💻 **Privacy Engineers & Analytics Architects** — dissect cookie, tag, and consent failures  
- 🏛️ **Enterprise platforms** — building next-gen systems where every signal is traceable and governed

## 🧠 What’s Inside

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `00-docs/` | RCA frameworks, strategic guides, industry mapping, glossary |
| `01-signal-watch/` | Staging ground for weak signals and potential RCA candidates |
| `10-zero-leak/` | Live RCA loops (ZeroLeak RCA™) with full architecture + recovery |
| `visuals/` | Diagrams and architecture visuals used across RCA documentation |
| `LICENSE.md` | Rights and terms for reuse, forks, and contributions |

## 💡 What Makes This System Unique?

✅ **ZeroLeak RCA™** — a rare framework to isolate root signal issues across the stack  
✅ **Live RCA from real environments** (not dummy bugs)  
✅ **Visual-first** root cause breakdowns with business impact mapping  
✅ **Cross-layer recovery logic** spanning tags, cookies, consent, and IDs

> “Where others see noise, we trace the signal.”

## 🔐 Public vs Private RCA Use Cases

Some RCAs in this system are public. Others remain private due to:

- NDA and sensitivity  
- Monetization potential  
- Leadership-level relevance only
