# Privacy Signal Systems

**A system-first architecture for digital trust, signal resilience, and RCA intelligence.**

---

## 🚀 Vision

In an era where consent, integrity, and intelligence define system credibility, this repository delivers a **modular RCA-driven framework** to resolve signal failures across digital environments.

We go beyond debugging — we build frameworks that harden trust at the architecture level.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Audiences

This system is designed for:

- **Executive stakeholders** — navigating compliance, data trust, and signal governance
- **Technical and data leaders** — who architect journeys across marketing, analytics, and privacy domains
- **System-first institutions** — building intelligent platforms where every signal reflects intent and integrity

## 🧠 What’s Inside

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `00_docs/` | System intelligence — architecture, industry mapping, and RCA ROI |
| `signal-watch/` | Staging ground for signal issues pre-RCA (by type) |
| `use-cases/` | RCA-approved impact cases, mapped by industry |
| `LICENSE.md` | Licensing and usage terms |

## 💎 RCA Power

Every confirmed issue in this repository is mapped through a **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** model — ensuring resolution at the architecture level.

Each RCA includes:

- Quantified data & monetary leakage
- Industry-aligned impact
- Signal integrity redesign logic

> “We don’t chase bugs. We outgrow them with signal-aware systems.”
