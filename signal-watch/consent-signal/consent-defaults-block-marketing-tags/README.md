Marketing tags are silently blocked due to CMP default settings, which pre-opt users out without interaction.

## 🔍 What Was Observed

- CMP toggles pre-set to opt-out by default  
- Users never actively confirmed — but tags were skipped  
- GTM logic tied to a strict consent string  
- Results in 0% fire rate on certain audiences

## 🚦 Why It Matters

- Marketers see drop in coverage but no errors  
- Campaign ROI appears low despite real user activity  
- Creates friction between legal and growth teams  
- Can affect performance of remarketing and personalization
