# 🔒 Dark Pattern in Consent Timer

Observed consent banners with countdown timers that auto-accept consent if no action is taken — a questionable design pattern.

---

## 🚨 What Happens

- User lands → 5-second timer auto-accepts all consent categories
- No active opt-in, just passive timeout

---

## 💣 Why It’s a Problem

- Breaks active consent principle under GDPR
- May be challenged in audits or user lawsuits
- Creates silent compliance risk across jurisdictions

## ⏳ RCA Potential

Strong candidate for a “Dark Patterns in Consent UX” RCA series, especially for finance, healthcare, and education portals.
