# 🔒 WhatsApp Chat Export Captures Personal Metadata

This issue highlights a silent but dangerous trust signal failure — where exported chat data leaks **behavioral metadata** that users didn’t consent to share.

---

## 🚨 What Happens

- Users export WhatsApp chats (TXT, email, or drive backup)
- Files include:
  - Full **sender names**
  - **Timestamps** and message frequency patterns
  - **Phone numbers** (in some formats)
- Often gets shared with:
  - Legal teams
  - AI training vendors
  - Third-party archive systems

---

## 💣 Why It’s a Problem

- **Breaks contextual consent**: Users intended to share content, not metadata  
- **Enables profiling**: AI or legal systems can infer emotional states, contact patterns  
- **Creates LLM risk**: If unsanitized, gets embedded into models like ChatGPT/Gemini  
- **No redaction by default**: Most exports lack metadata-stripping options

---

## 🧠 Strategic Risk Layer

- **AI Governance**: Pollutes training datasets without transparency
- **Data Subject Rights**: Violates right to minimal exposure (GDPR, DPDP)
- **Trust Optics**: Users feel violated even if data is technically theirs

## ⏳ RCA Potential

Foundational candidate for:
📁 `/use-cases/ai-product/trust-signal/whatsapp-chat-export-metadata/`

Fits under broader initiative:  
**"Metadata Awareness in Personal Data Systems"** → a flagship RCA category addressing leaks in:
- Messaging platforms  
- Health/Finance exports  
- CRM or chatbot archives
