# 🛡️ Trust Signal — Observation Zone

This folder contains verified observations where **digital trust, user consent, or intent fidelity** is silently compromised — often without triggering visible errors in analytics or platform logs.

These signals are undergoing deep investigation via the **ZeroLeak RCA™** framework. Once root causes are mapped and resolved, qualified cases are migrated to `/10-zero-leak/` as finalized RCA loops.

## 🔍 Examples of Trust Signal Breakages

- Tags firing on pages **before user interaction or consent**
- PII unintentionally exposed in **URLs, headers, or payloads**
- Consent banners present but **not technically enforced**
- Pixels or trackers executing **without valid user permission**
- Mismatched cookies or values leading to **trust-reporting gaps**

---

## 📁 Folder Contents

This folder currently includes:

- `README.md` — Overview and principles
- In-progress Markdown cases under evaluation

Each case is named using a clear convention based on **signal nature** and **issue type**.  
Example file names:

- `unintended-tag-fire-on-sensitive-page.md`
- `pii-leakage-via-url-querystring.md`

## 🧠 Purpose of This Folder

- To **contain and classify high-trust-risk issues** prior to RCA conversion
- To serve as a **sandbox for consent, intent, and data misuse evaluation**
- To ensure systematic RCA handling for cases that affect **brand trust, compliance, or attribution**

## ✅ ZeroLeak RCA™ Alignment

All trust signals here are being:

- ✅ Mapped against consent and signal intent flows
- ✅ Diagnosed for architectural or logic-level flaws
- ✅ Prioritized based on **user harm, business exposure, and CXO urgency**

This ensures every trust-risk case is traceable, repairable, and aligned with ZeroLeak RCA™ principles.
