# 🔒 Trust Signal

This folder captures issues that **erode user trust** — even when tracking may be technically compliant.

These are silent fractures in the platform’s moral architecture, where user perception diverges from system logic.

---

## 🚨 Examples of Trust Signal Issues

- Tracking on login, payment, or form pages without clarity
- Opt-out experiences that are buried, inconsistent, or non-sticky
- Data collection on sensitive journeys (e.g., healthcare, minors)
- Reactivation of trackers after user explicitly opted out

---

## 🔍 Why It Matters

- Erodes **platform credibility**, even when legally compliant
- Breeds perception of **dark patterns** and manipulative UX
- Triggers **PR blowouts, regulator attention**, and user revolt
- Breaks trust for high-sensitivity verticals like gov, health, finance

---

## 🎯 Strategic Lens

- These issues rarely get flagged in QA or compliance audits
- They are noticed by the **most important users** — activists, journalists, regulators, and CxOs
- Fixing them often requires **architectural clarity, not just legal checklists**
