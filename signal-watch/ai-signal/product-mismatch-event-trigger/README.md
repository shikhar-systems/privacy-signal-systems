# 🧠 Product Mismatch in Event Trigger

This issue involves DOM-based event triggers picking up the wrong product ID or name when the dataLayer is incomplete or delayed at the time of tag execution.

---

## 🚨 What Happens

- User lands on product page
- GTM tag or GA4 event fires before product details fully render
- Incorrect or blank product ID is sent to analytics or pixel
- Personalization engines or AI-based recommendations use faulty data

---

## 💣 Why It’s a Problem

- Pollutes product-level analytics
- Misguides recommendation engines and merchandising logic
- Breaks trust in AI/ML systems relying on accurate user intent

---

## 🧠 Observed Context

I saw this issue in real implementations where tags fired via DOM listener (`.product-id`) before the product info had loaded from an API.
