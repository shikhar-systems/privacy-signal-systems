# 🧠 Quantity Overfire Due to DOM Triggers

In this issue, the event tracking `quantity` or `add_to_cart` fires multiple times due to DOM listeners reacting to small layout changes or re-renders.

---

## 🚨 What Happens

- User selects quantity or triggers `Add to Cart`
- DOM listener fires `add_to_cart` or `quantity` multiple times
- GA4/Meta sees inflated event data
- Misalignment between user intent and tracked signal

---

## 💣 Why It’s a Problem

- Affects ecommerce forecasting and conversion accuracy
- Misleads marketing spend decisions on product categories
- Pollutes AI-based shopping prediction or bundle logic

---

## 🧠 Observed Context

I debugged this in ecommerce platforms where UI frameworks like Angular/Vue re-rendered quantity components on small changes — firing DOM-based triggers again unintentionally.
