# 📉 AI Signal – Firebase Install Event Loss (GA4 Integration Gap)

In several GA4-Firebase app integrations, the critical `install_event` was **silently dropped**, despite correct SDK implementation.  
This breaks foundational AI signals like onboarding prediction, user cohorting, and retention modeling.

---

## 🔍 What Was Detected

- GA4 dashboard missing expected install events from new users
- Firebase SDK correctly implemented with no console errors
- Consent or network sync timing delayed `first_open`/`session_start`
- App Instance ID sometimes not registered before network event fired

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters (AI Perspective)

- AI models trained on lifecycle stages fail to map new users
- Funnel predictions become inaccurate (no clear entry point)
- ROAS and retention metrics skew due to broken attribution
- High LTV segments underreported or missed

## 📈 RCA Escalation Path

Promoted to full RCA after:

✅ Pattern confirmed across environments  
✅ Mobile team validated misfire via SDK logs  
✅ Resolved through early consent load and app instance sync checks
