# 🤖 AI Signal – Personalization Drift from Consent Loss

AI personalization engines rely on stable consented inputs. When consent layers block or drop key triggers, AI decisions start to drift — delivering irrelevant, repetitive, or even risky outputs.

---

## 📍 Early Indicators

- Sudden drop in AI performance post-CMP rollout  
- Low-quality recommendations despite user interaction  
- Incomplete audience profiles built from partial data  

---

## 🔍 Example Scenarios

- A recommender system suggests unrelated products after opt-out  
- Personalization ignores regional signals due to blocked consent-triggered geolocation  
- Engagement scores remain high but result in low relevance responses

## ⏳ RCA Escalation Path
