# 🤖 AI Signal

This folder highlights **anomalies that could distort AI model training, personalization, or automation logic**.

---

## 🚨 Examples of AI Signal Issues

- Duplicate or noisy event data polluting training sets
- Noisy consent signals being used as personalization inputs
- Misclassified user behavior causing wrong cohort mapping
- Trigger stacking inflating engagement metrics

---

## 🔍 Why It Matters

- Leads to model hallucinations or user targeting failures
- Reduces explainability and auditability of automated systems
- Breaks trust in AI-powered experiences
- Corrupts AI decisions across eCommerce, healthcare, education, and governance platforms

## ⏳ RCA Potential

These anomalies can escalate into full RCA use cases under:
- `ai-product/` (e.g., hallucinations from consent-unaware signals)
- `ecommerce/` (e.g., personalization misfires from stacked triggers)
- `healthcare/` (e.g., AI alerts based on misclassified signals)
