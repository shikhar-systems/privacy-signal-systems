# 🤖 AI Signal — Pre-RCA Monitoring Layer

This folder captures **signal-level anomalies that distort AI behavior silently** — long before failures appear in dashboards or model outputs.

These are not model bugs.  
They’re **input-side fractures**: noisy triggers, consent-blind events, and misfired personalization logic that can derail entire AI systems.

---

## 🔍 What AI Signal Anomalies Look Like

- Duplicated or noisy events polluting training sets  
- Consent-ambiguous triggers reaching personalization engines  
- Misclassified user actions corrupting intent prediction  
- Stacked engagement triggers skewing optimization algorithms

## 🚨 Why This Matters

| Signal Risk            | AI Consequence                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Broken event flow      | Hallucinations, unsafe LLM output         |
| Consent-blind input    | Legal exposure, personalization flaws     |
| Drifted cohorts        | Irrelevant product recos or alerts        |
| Inconsistent tagging   | Loss of explainability and model trust    |

> These aren’t dev bugs — they’re **system signal leaks** that ruin AI behavior silently.

## 🛰️ What This Folder Enables

- **Trace early warning signs** of AI performance drift  
- Provide **QA visibility** into events affecting model integrity  
- Enable **C-suite confidence** in AI personalization & automation  
- Track what might **never surface in traditional QA** pipelines

## 🧪 Escalation to RCA

AI signal issues here may be escalated to `/use-cases/` when:

✅ Reproducible  
✅ Impacting a system or user outcome  
✅ Mappable to architecture or data layer  
✅ Validated through platform/network tracing
