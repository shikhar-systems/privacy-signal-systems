# 🤖 AI Signal — Pre-RCA Monitoring Layer

This folder captures **anomalies that silently distort AI model behavior** — from training bias to broken personalization logic and explainability gaps.

These are the signals **too technical for marketing** and **too subtle for dashboards** — but critical to future-proofing AI.

---

## 🔍 What AI Signal Anomalies Look Like

- Noisy or duplicated inputs polluting training sets  
- Consent-ambiguous events reaching personalization layers  
- Trigger stacking that inflates engagement metrics  
- Misclassified user paths causing cohort or intent drift

## 🚨 Why It Matters

| Risk | AI Consequence |
|------|----------------|
| Broken signals | Hallucinations, unsafe outputs |
| Consent-blind inputs | Legal/audit failures |
| Inconsistent tags | Personalization breakdown |
| Drifted training logic | Model bias, performance loss |

These risks affect every AI touchpoint — from ecommerce recommendations to public health alerts and generative interfaces.

## ⏳ RCA Promotion Path

When validated, these anomalies escalate into formal RCA-backed cases under:

- `/use-cases/ai-product/`  
  (e.g., hallucinations from malformed signal flow)
- `/use-cases/ecommerce/`  
  (e.g., recommendation drift from noisy engagement signals)
- `/use-cases/healthcare/`  
  (e.g., AI alerts triggered by misclassified opt-in paths)

## 🛰️ Why This Layer Exists

Most AI failures don’t start in the model — they start in the **input pipeline**.  
This folder gives your team a way to monitor, track, and escalate the earliest signs of AI signal corruption.
