# 🤖 AI Signal — Pre-RCA Monitoring Layer

This folder highlights **anomalies that quietly distort AI behavior** — including training bias, personalization misfires, and decision automation drift.

These are the invisible cracks that break AI trust before dashboards ever notice.

---

## 🔍 What AI Signal Anomalies Look Like

- Duplicate or noisy event streams polluting training sets  
- Consent-ambiguous inputs reaching AI-driven personalization  
- Misclassified user actions causing cohort drift  
- Trigger stacking inflating engagement or model weights

---

## 🚨 Why It Matters

- Causes silent hallucinations or decision errors  
- Breaks explainability, auditability, and compliance trails  
- Reduces confidence in AI-powered journeys (ecommerce, healthcare, edtech, public systems)  
- Magnifies risk in both real-time and training-time decisions

## ⏳ RCA Promotion Path

AI signal anomalies in this folder may be elevated to full RCA under:

- `/use-cases/ai-product/` (e.g., LLM hallucinations from malformed input signals)  
- `/use-cases/ecommerce/` (e.g., engagement loops inflating recommender bias)  
- `/use-cases/healthcare/` (e.g., misfired alerts from consent-blind inputs)

🛰️ This layer exists to make silent failure observable — before AI outcomes become irreversible.
