# 👁️ signal-watch/ — Observation Staging Zone

This folder tracks **early-stage signal breakages** before they graduate into full ZeroLeak RCA™ loops.

> Think of this as the **observation radar** — where weak signals, suspicious behaviors, or partial failures are captured, logged, and mapped to potential root causes.

## 🧠 Why This Folder Exists

Many of the **costliest digital leaks** begin as subtle breaks —  
- A tag firing too early  
- A signal missing in only some browsers  
- A consent toggle breaking attribution silently  

These issues often get dismissed or overlooked.  
Here, we treat them as **pre-RCA seeds** — potential high-value breakdowns in trust, attribution, or signal logic.

## 🔁 Observation Lifecycle

| Stage | Folder | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 📍 In Progress | `in-progress/` | Loose or raw observations where the signal class is not yet clear. Used for logging real bugs, hypotheses, or monitoring leads that may become valid RCA. |
| 🧭 Signal Classification | `trust-signal/`, `ai-signal/`, etc. | Observation has been validated and signal category confirmed (e.g., trust breach, AI drift, attribution loss). RCA logic is still being built or queued. |
| 🧪 Final RCA | `10-zero-leak/` | Fully dissected RCA with monetizable impact, diagrams, and architectural solution. Promoted from signal-watch into GitHub Vault or RCA library. |

Each RCA begins with **early sensing**, then matures across this pipeline.

## 📂 Current Signal Categories

| Folder | Signal Type |
|--------|-------------|
| `trust-signal/` | Breaks in intent, tag firing order, or misaligned user trust flows |
| `ai-signal/` | Signal drift, hallucination, or broken handoff in AI systems |
| `attribution-signal/` | Broken marketing + analytics journeys due to ID mismatch, wrong UTM, etc. |
| `in-progress/` | Initial observations, awaiting deeper classification |

## 🚫 What You Won’t See Here (By Design)

- No **full RCA logic or diagrams**  
- No **proprietary architecture fixes**  
- No **client-specific identifiers or screenshots**

This zone is safe to share, track, and showcase — without exposing your deeper IP or RCA insights.
