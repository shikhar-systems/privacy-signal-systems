# 📡 SignalWatch — RCA Staging Ground

This folder is the **pre-RCA staging area**. Every subfolder here reflects a category of **signal integrity risk** (e.g. trust, attribution, consent, AI).

It’s not just a bug queue — it’s a **signal intelligence radar**, where we monitor silent leaks *before* they escalate into full RCA loops.

## 🧭 Folder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `trust-signal/` | Signals where trust is broken: wrong page tags, unexpected PII, false conversion triggers |
| `attribution-signal/` | Broken user journeys: ID mismatch, tag fired but no data, value or currency mismatch |
| `ai-signal/` | Signal drift in AI systems: hallucinations, personalization loss, prompt-induced leakage |
| `consent-signal/` | User opt-out, CMP misfiring, or consent block not handled with fallback |
| `in-progress/` | Observations under validation — yet to be moved into final folders |

## 📍 What Makes a Case RCA-Ready?

✅ Reproducible with clear trigger → failure chain  
✅ Has signal-level root cause (not a UI or tool bug)  
✅ Mapped user, business, and system impact  
✅ Recoverable with signal architecture redesign

## 🎯 Long-Term Vision

SignalWatch lets you:

- 🛡️ Protect systems from blind leaks
- 🧠 Train analysts to *think in signals*
- 🏗️ Build RCA discipline into product and growth teams
- 🚫 Avoid false fixes by detecting what’s *really* broken
