# 🛰️ Signal-Watch

`signal-watch/` is the active staging ground for signals that **haven’t yet completed RCA** but show clear signs of architectural, behavioral, or consent-related issues.

This system is used to **capture, categorize, and evaluate** these weak signals — before they escalate into silent monetary leaks or trust failures.

---

## 🧠 Observation Lifecycle

Each signal observed follows this lifecycle:

```
Observed → Staged in Signal-Watch → RCA Confirmed → Promoted to /use-cases/
```

Signals that do **not** meet RCA criteria may still be retained here for future reference, especially if related signals emerge later.

## 🧩 ZeroLeak RCA™ Compliance

Only signals aligned with ZeroLeak RCA™ standards are tracked here.  
This means each observation must meet **minimum traceability and integrity checks** — even if the full RCA has not been performed yet.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each subfolder under `signal-watch/` represents a **signal class**.

Example categories:

- `trust-signal/` — trust erosion, misfiring pixels, misaligned intent  
- `ai-signal/` — chatbot failures, AI hallucinations, personalization drift  
- `attribution-signal/` — journey stitching issues, user ID mismatches  
- `consent-signal/` — signals blocked or delayed due to consent settings  
- `data-signal/` — invalid parameter values, incorrect payloads  
- `in-progress/` — early-stage signals being evaluated  

> 🛠️ More folders may be added over time as RCA types evolve.

## 📬 Collaboration & Contributions

If you’ve observed a weak signal worth staging, please raise an issue or submit a PR.  
This folder is designed to **grow with real-world complexity** — and feedback is always welcome.
