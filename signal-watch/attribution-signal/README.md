# 🎯 Attribution Signal

This folder captures issues where **the source, campaign, or channel attribution fails or is misrepresented** — often silently, until it's too late.

---

## 🚨 Common Attribution Failures

- `not set` values in GA4 for source/medium/campaign  
- Referrer stripped or blocked due to redirects or iFrames  
- Inconsistent UTM propagation across session flow  
- Cookies overwritten or expired before conversion  
- Platform misalignment between ad click and landing page  

---

## 💣 Why It Matters

- Misrepresents marketing ROI and customer acquisition cost  
- Breaks funnel continuity and user journey tracking  
- Wastes budget due to distorted attribution paths  
- Undermines A/B tests, retargeting, and segmentation

## 📍 RCA Path Potential

Most attribution issues begin as signal glitches and mature into systemic RCA use cases — especially in:

- Single Page Apps (SPA)
- Cross-domain environments
- Long funnel journeys with multi-touchpoints
