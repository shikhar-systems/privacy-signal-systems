# 🧠 Predictive QA Framework Use Cases

This folder contains use cases that highlight **preventable tracking failures** — issues that could have been caught by predictive logic or architectural validation before data corruption reached GA4 or other systems.

## 🛠️ RCA Category

**Type:** Preventable DOM-based or logic-based data errors  
**Focus:** Building QA rules into tag logic, DOM readiness, and trigger design  
**Goal:** Avoid signal corruption and business impact by detecting patterns early

## 🎯 Use Cases in This Folder

| Folder Name                           | Summary |
|----------------------------------------|---------|
| `product-mismatch-event-trigger/`      | Wrong product info sent due to incomplete DOM at tag fire time |
| `quantity-overfire-due-to-dom/`        | Quantity/add-to-cart event fires multiple times due to DOM listeners or UI re-renders |

## 🔍 Why Predictive QA?

- Prevents loss of trust in product-level and cart analytics  
- Avoids long debugging cycles by validating trigger logic upfront  
- Enables scalable, resilient tracking design for complex ecommerce journeys
