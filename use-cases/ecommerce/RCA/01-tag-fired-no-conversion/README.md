# RCA 01 â€“ Deprecated (Merged into RCA 02)

This use case was initially being developed as **RCA 01**, focused on:

> "Tag fired in GTM, but cookie sync failed due to mid-flight redirect."

After deeper analysis, this scenario was found to be technically and causally overlapping with RCA 02.

ðŸ§­ **Final Status: This RCA has been fully merged into RCA 02**  
ðŸ“‚ Please refer to: [RCA 02 â€“ Redirect Cookie Sync Failure](../02_tag-fired-redirect-cookie-sync-failed/)

That folder now contains the full root cause, logic breakdown, impact analysis, and solution for both RCA 01 and RCA 02 combined.
