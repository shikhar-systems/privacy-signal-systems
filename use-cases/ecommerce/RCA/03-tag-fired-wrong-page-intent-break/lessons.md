### Key Lessons
1. **“/” catches everything** — one slash can distort millions.  
2. **Consent ≠ Intent** — CMP was green, intent vector broken.  
3. **Automate trigger linting** — a 2-line CI rule prevents six-figure mistakes.  
4. **Prefer dataLayer events over URL rules** — decouples tracking from URL structure and supports single-page apps.
