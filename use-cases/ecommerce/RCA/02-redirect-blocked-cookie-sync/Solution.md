# 🛠️ Solution – Secure Pixel Routing Without Breaking Identity

### ✅ Fix Summary:
- Removed redirect-layered (Mimecast) URL.
- Replaced with **direct vendor endpoint** supporting 302 redirect.
- Ensured endpoint responds with:
  - `Status: 302 Found`
  - Proper `Set-Cookie` headers

### 🔒 Why It Worked:
- 302 is browser-handled and **preserves headers**
- No intermediate hop = No cookie loss
- Direct routing ensures **vendor server receives full identity context**

### 🧭 Best Practice Recommendation:
- Avoid URL shorteners or redirect services (e.g., Mimecast, Bitly) for critical identity sync pixels
- Prefer server responses like 302 over 307 in user-tracking workflows
- Always validate behavior via:
  - **Network tab (DevTools)**
  - **Application tab (cookies, local storage)**
