## Lessons Learned

1. ✅ A fired tag ≠ a completed signal — syncing must be verified end-to-end.
2. 🧠 Redirects (e.g. 307) silently block data transfer unless monitored.
3. 🔁 Cookie-based systems require active monitoring for sync failures.
4. 🎯 Always QA the signal delivery, not just the GTM fire.
