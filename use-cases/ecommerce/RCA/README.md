# 🧩 Ecommerce RCA Library

This folder contains live and validated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) use cases for ecommerce tracking, attribution, and consent signal failures.

Each case reflects a production-impacting issue in digital commerce platforms — such as:

- Missing or broken conversion signals
- GTM misfires or misconfigured triggers
- Consent interference with marketing or analytics
- Redirects blocking cookie syncs or attribution
- Misalignment between browser signal vs vendor-side capture
