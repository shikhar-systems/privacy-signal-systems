# 🧩 Use Cases — RCA-Approved System Failures

This folder contains validated use cases that **originated from weak signal anomalies** and were confirmed through a full **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** loop.

Each case represents a **system-level failure** — from signal to trust — with **real monetizable or regulatory impact**.

---

## 🔍 What Qualifies as a Use Case?

Every RCA use case in this repository is:

✅ Reproducible in test or live environments  
✅ Mapped through the Consent → Signal → RCA chain  
✅ Monetizable (saves/reclaims revenue or prevents legal risk)  
✅ Architecturally relevant (affects GTM, GA4, CMP, or AI stack)  
✅ Tiered by industry verticals for practical stakeholder alignment

|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ecommerce/`       | Signal drift in GTM/GA4 pipelines, quantity duplication, attribution gaps |
| `fintech/`         | Consent violations, login signal leaks, timing-related compliance breakdowns |
| `govstack/`        | Multilingual consent failure, cross-domain attribution gaps, trust erosion |
| `enterprise/`      | Complex CMP-GTM sync failures, SPA tracking errors, audit risks     |
| `ai-product/`      | Noisy or biased signal pipelines affecting AI training or personalization |
| `retail-media/`    | Misfiring pixels, metadata leaks, and campaign drop-offs affecting ROAS |

> These folders are tags, not silos — every RCA is modular and often reusable across sectors.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each use case is structured into 4 files:

| File            | Description                                      | Access     |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `README.md`     | Summary of the issue and RCA snapshot            | Public     |
| `architecture.md` | Consent → Signal → RCA mapping with diagrams   | On Request |
| `impact.md`     | Revenue loss, compliance risk, or trust damage   | On Request |
| `solution.md`   | System-level fix with strategic value            | On Request |

## 🔐 Why We Don’t Expose Everything Publicly

- RCA intelligence is original IP
- Impact and fix logic can be **exploited by low-quality vendors**
- Access is **shared upon validation**, usually with:
  - CIOs, CDOs, CPOs or CEOs
  - Legal or privacy officers
  - Government digital stack teams
  - AI ethics and audit frameworks

## 🧠 Use This Folder To

- Build high-trust interviews with RCA-backed credibility
- Educate teams and stakeholders on signal integrity
- Influence CxOs without direct outreach
- Create GitHub and LinkedIn magnetism from quiet technical depth

> “This folder doesn’t expose code — it reveals trust leaks in modern systems. Fix them, and you don’t just solve bugs — you lead movements.”
