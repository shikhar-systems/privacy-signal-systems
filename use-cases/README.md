# 🧩 Use Cases — RCA-Approved System Failures

This folder contains validated use cases that passed the Signal Watch stage and were confirmed through Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Each is mapped to an industry vertical and represents a system-level flaw with real impact.

## 🔍 What Qualifies as a Use Case?

Each issue in this folder is:

✅ Reproducible  
✅ RCA-validated  
✅ System-linked (consent → signal → RCA)  
✅ Monetizable or risk-relevant  
✅ Mapped by industry and signal type

## 📁 Folder Contents

Each folder includes:

- `README.md`: Use case summary (non-sensitive)
- `architecture.md`: Consent → Signal → RCA mapping *(available on request)*
