# 🧩 Use Cases — RCA-Approved System Failures

This folder contains validated system-level failures that passed the `Signal Watch` phase and were confirmed through Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Each issue is tied to real-world monetizable risk, user trust gaps, or AI/system drift — and mapped to its relevant industry vertical.

## 🔐 Why Limited Access?

The system thinking in these RCAs carries **strategic weight** — often touching:

- Privacy design
- Cross-team ownership
- Future audit defense
- Platform redesign costs

To preserve integrity and originality:

> 🔒 Core RCA files are only shared with verified senior stakeholders:
- Chief Data/Privacy/Technology Officers  
- Government or legal review panels  
- Board-level or AI policy governance teams
