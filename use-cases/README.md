# 🧩 Validated Use Cases — RCA-Classified Signal Failures

This folder contains confirmed use cases that passed the Signal Watch stage and were validated through Root Cause Analysis (RCA).  
Each issue reflects a **system-level signal failure** with tangible impact — monetizable, reputational, or compliance-based.

---

## 🔍 What Qualifies as a Use Case?

To be included here, a case must be:

✅ Reproducible and RCA-verified  
✅ Linked to systemic architecture (Consent → Signal → RCA)  
✅ Rooted in real-world tracking, measurement, or signal leakage  
✅ Monetizable, legally significant, or product-breaking  
✅ Categorized by industry and mapped to signal types
