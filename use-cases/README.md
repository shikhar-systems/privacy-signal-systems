# 🧩 Use Cases — RCA-Approved System Failures

This folder contains validated use cases that passed the Signal Watch stage and were confirmed through Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Each use case is mapped to an industry vertical and represents a **system-level flaw with real-world impact**.

---

## 🔍 What Qualifies as a Use Case?

Each issue here is:

✅ Reproducible  
✅ RCA-validated  
✅ System-linked (Consent → Signal → RCA)  
✅ Monetizable or compliance-relevant  
✅ Categorized by industry and signal type
