# 📺 Retail Media & Publisher Network Use Cases

This folder captures RCA-backed signal issues affecting publisher networks, ad monetization platforms, and commerce-media ecosystems.

---

## ⚠️ Common Challenges

- Consent not captured before ad impression or targeting
- Misattributed ad click → conversion paths
- Overlapping pixels leading to inflated impressions
- Signal leakage across retail and content subdomains
- Delayed signal injection from CMP → real-time bidding lag

---

## 🧠 Strategic Impact

- Platform mischarges advertisers for ghost clicks or views
- Regulatory exposure from consentless targeting (GDPR, CPRA)
- Biased attribution reports to brand partners
- Lower trust from media buyers or agencies
